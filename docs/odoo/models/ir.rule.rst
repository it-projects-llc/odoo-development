 ir.rule
=========

Record rules are conditions that records must satisfy for an operation (create, read, write or delete) to be allowed. Example of a condition: *User can update Task that assigned to him*.

Group field defines for which group rule is applied. If Group is not specified, then rule is *global* and applied for all users.

Domain field defines conditions for records.

Boolean fields (read, write, create, delete) of ir.rule mean *Apply this rule for this kind of operation*. They do **not** mean *restrict access for this kind of operation*.

Checking access algorithm
=========================
To check either user has access for example to *read* a record, system do as following:

* Check access according to :doc:`ir.model.access <ir.model.access>` records. If it doesn't pass, then user **doesn't get** access

* Find and check global rules for the **model** and for *read* operation

  * if the record **doesn't satisfy** (doesn't fit to domain) for at least one of the global rules, then user **doesn't get** access

* Find and check non-global rules for the **model** and for *read* operation.

  * if there are no such groups, then user **get** access
  * if the record **satisfy** (fit to domain) for **at least one** of the non-global rules, then user **get** access
  * if the record **doesn't satisfy** for **all**  non-global rules, then user **doesn't get** access
