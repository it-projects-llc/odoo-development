 Reports models via  PostgreSQL views
======================================

`Postgres View <https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-createview.html>`_ is a kind of table, which is not physically materialized. Instead, the query is run every time the view is referenced in a query.

To create Postgres View in odoo do as follows:

* create new model
* all fields must have the flag ``readonly=True``.
* specify the parameter ``_auto=False`` to the odoo model, so no table corresponding to the fields is created automatically.
* add a method ``init(self, cr)`` that creates a PostgreSQL View matching the fields declared in the model.
* add views for the model in a usual way

Example:

.. code-block:: py

    from odoo import api, fields, models, tools
    
    
    class ReportEventRegistrationQuestions(models.Model):
        _name = "event.question.report"
        _auto = False
    
        attendee_id = fields.Many2one(comodel_name='event.registration', string='Registration')
        question_id = fields.Many2one(comodel_name='event.question', string='Question')
        answer_id = fields.Many2one(comodel_name='event.answer', string='Answer')
        event_id = fields.Many2one(comodel_name='event.event', string='Event')
    
        @api.model_cr
        def init(self):
            """ Event Question main report """
            tools.drop_view_if_exists(self._cr, 'event_question_report')
            self._cr.execute(""" CREATE VIEW event_question_report AS (
                SELECT
                    att_answer.id as id,
                    att_answer.event_registration_id as attendee_id,
                    answer.question_id as question_id,
                    answer.id as answer_id,
